# Improved-PINNs-and-MPINNs-solvers

This repository contains the code implementations used for the research paper titled "Improved PINNs and MPINNs solvers for modeling water flow and nitrogen transport in unsaturated soils."

Key Points:

(a) For a detailed understanding of the numerical setup for each case, please refer to the accompanying research paper.

(b) The PINNs solvers are implemented using the TensorFlow library.

(c) Data related to test case A can be found in [insert_path_here].

Getting Started:
To use the code, follow these steps:

1. UUse Google Colab or set up the code on your local machine.
1. Install the required libraries, including TensorFlow.
1. Explore the code files to understand the implementation details.

Note:

This repository is intended to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners interested in advanced solvers for solving partial differential equations related to water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soils.

Contributions and improvements are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for any questions or suggestions.
